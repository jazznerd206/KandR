Variables and constants are the manipulables in a given program. The #define statements dictate what the variables of a 
program are, and the operators are the functions declared directly after them.

Expressions combine variables and operators to produce new values, i.e. operators in actual usage.


Variable names:
-> made up of letters and digits
-> at least the first 31 characters of an internal name are insignificant
-> only 6 characters are guaranteed to unique properties for external variables

It is wise to choose names that are related to the purpose of the variable and that are nulikely to get lexographically confused.

Short names -> local variables
Long names -> external variables
Capitalize -> constants
