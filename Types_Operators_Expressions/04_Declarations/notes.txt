All variables must be declared before use, although certain declarations can be made inferred by content. A declaration specifies a type, and variable names.
Putting all your variables on one line looks cool and saves space, but declaring them individually gives the developer more control over the commenting on each parameter.

After a variable is declared, it must be initialized. This can happen at the beginning of the file or at the beignning of a loop, but it must happen.

The qualifier const can be apploed to the declaration of any variable that has an unchanging value, cannot be altered in any way.
