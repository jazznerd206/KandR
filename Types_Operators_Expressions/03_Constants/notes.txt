INTEGER -> 123 / 1 / 1230894
	- can be specified in OCTAL or HEXIDECIMAL instead of decimal
	- a leading zero on an integer constant defines it as an octal
	- a leading 0X means hexidecimal
	- 31 (decimal) = 037 (octal) = 0x1f (hexidecimal)
	- both OCTAL and HEXIDECIMAL can be appended with typings, 0xFUL is an unsigned long constant with the value 15 decimal
LONG -> 2341322L (must end in L)
FLOAT -> 12.3 / 1.234 (contains a decimal) or an exponent (le-2) or both
	THE TYPE OF A FLOAT IS A DOUBLE UNLESS THE WIZARD SAYS OTHERWISE
CHARACTER -> integer, written as a char with single quotes, 'x'
	- the value of a character constant is the numeric value of the character in the machines character set
	- common library is ASCII, you know this MAAANNNN
	- certain characters can be substituted for common escape sequences
/*
#define VTAB '\013' ascii vertical tab
#define VELL '\007' ascii bell character
*/

STRING -> also known as a string literal, is a sequence of zero or more characters in a row delimited by double quotes
	-techincally, a string is just a array of char with a '\0' denoting the end of it in storage.

ENUM -> list of constant integer values
	- the first name in an enum has value 0, second has value 1.. etc unless explicit values are specified
/*
enum months ( JAN = 1, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEPT, OCT, NOV, DEC };
*/


ALL ESCAPE SEQUENCES
\a -> alert/bell
\b ->  backspace
\f -> formfeed
\n -> newline
\r - carriage return (silly windows, right)
\t -> horizontal tab
\v -> vertical tab
\\ - backlash
\? -> question mark
\' -> single quote
\" ->  double quote
\ooo -> octal number
\xhh -> hex number
