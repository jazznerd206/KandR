Exercise 1-11: How would you test the word counting program? What kinds of input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

Testing this program involves validating the input. First pass a standard string, then I would pass all escape sequences. 
Then all spaces and maybe special characters.

This program hinges on the condition (c = getchar() != EOF), so if in any case of a file not having an EOF marker, this 
function will never close.
