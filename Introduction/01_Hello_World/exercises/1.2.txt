Exercise 1-2: Experiment to find out what happens when the print statement string argument contains "\c", where c is some
character not listed above.

helloworld.c: In function ‘main’:
helloworld.c:15:9: warning: unknown escape sequence: '\c'
  printf("\c");


This is the resulting error. "\c" is not recognized as a valid escape character, so the program will not compile.
