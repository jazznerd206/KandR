Exercise 1-1: Compile and run the hello world program and experiment with the code. What error messages can you get?

When the code compiles correctly, I get 2 lines, each reading hello word. the first HW is return with one line of code and 
the second is that same line broken up into the three individual pieces, each word and the newline character getting their 
own print statements.
