In C, all function arguments are passed by value, not by reference. This means that the values accepted as parameters by a 
function are actually temporary variables with corresponding data, not the original data object. DIFFERENT THAN JS.

Using call by value can often lead to more compat programs with fewer extraneous variables because parameters can be reated 
as conveniently intialized local variable to the routine.

When necessary, it is possible to modify the original value inside of a called routine. The parameter must be packaged with 
its original location, a pointer. CHAPTER 5

Arrays are the special case, as the original values of arrays get passed into the parameters. No copying of elements.
